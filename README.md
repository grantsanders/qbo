# Quickbooks Invoicing progrtam

## test project I built to teach myself to:

•Build applications using REST apis <br />
•Get some experience with oauth2 <br />
•Work with Spring boot <br />
•Build understanding of MVC architecture <br />
•Build a (technically, although the frontend is Swing) fullstack web app <br />
•Make my coworkers' weekly invoicing take about 1/10 of the time
